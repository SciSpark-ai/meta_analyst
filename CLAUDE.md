# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Meta-Analyst is an installable Claude Code plugin containing a three-phase agentic pipeline that performs end-to-end clinical meta-analysis of RCT intervention studies following Cochrane Handbook methodology. Distributed as an open-source skill via `npx skills add SciSpark-ai/meta_analyst`.

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install scipy statsmodels numpy

python tests/test_effect_sizes.py       # 56/56 pass
python tests/test_pooling.py            # 63/63 pass
python tests/test_heterogeneity.py      # 60/60 pass
python tests/test_sensitivity.py        # 96/96 pass
python tests/test_publication_bias.py   # 69/69 pass
python tests/test_grade.py              # 52/52 pass
python tests/test_visualizations.py     # 53/53 pass
python tests/test_report.py             # 61/61 pass
```

All Python commands must run from `skills/meta-analyst/` directory for imports to resolve. Tests use a custom pass/fail counter (not pytest). They print results to stdout.

## Architecture

- `skills/meta-analyst/SKILL.md` — Skill entry point. Defines pipeline, phase execution order, output format, and Python code usage.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/effect_sizes.py` — Computes per-study effect sizes: log(OR), log(RR), RD (binary); MD, SMD/Hedges' g (continuous). Handles zero-cell correction (add 0.5 to all cells).
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/pooling.py` — DerSimonian-Laird random-effects, inverse-variance fixed-effect, and Mantel-Haenszel pooling. Exports `pool_random_effects()`, `pool_fixed_effect()`, `pool_mantel_haenszel()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/heterogeneity.py` — Cochran's Q, I², tau² (DL estimator), H², and prediction intervals. Exports `assess_heterogeneity()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/sensitivity.py` — Leave-one-out analysis, high-RoB study exclusion, fixed-vs-random model comparison. Exports `leave_one_out()`, `exclude_high_rob()`, `fixed_vs_random()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/publication_bias.py` — Egger's regression test (skips automatically if k < 10), funnel plot asymmetry data. Exports `egger_test()`, `funnel_plot_data()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/grade.py` — GRADE certainty rule engine: per-domain downgrade assessment (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias) + Summary of Findings table assembly. Exports `assess_grade()`, `build_sof_table()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/visualizations.py` — SVG generation for forest plot, funnel plot, PRISMA 2020 flow diagram, and RoB traffic light summary. Exports `forest_plot_svg()`, `funnel_plot_svg()`, `prisma_flow_svg()`, `rob_traffic_light_svg()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/pipeline/report.py` — Assembles full Cochrane-style meta-analysis report as Markdown + JSON dual output. Exports `assemble_report()`.
- `skills/meta-analyst/references/` — Phase specs the agent reads before executing each phase.

## Key Domain Rules

- **Default pooling**: DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model; switch to fixed-effect only when explicitly justified
- **I² interpretation**: Cochrane Handbook 10.10.2 (0–40% may not be important, 30–60% moderate, 50–90% substantial, 75–100% considerable)
- **Egger's test**: Only performed when k ≥ 10; skipped silently with a note when k < 10
- **GRADE starting point**: High for RCTs, Low for observational studies; downgrade only (never upgrade from RCT base)
- **Zero-cell correction**: Add 0.5 to all four cells of any 2×2 table containing a zero before computing log(OR) or log(RR)
- **GRADE indirectness**: Assessed by LLM reasoning against the PICO question; all other GRADE domains assessed by rule engine
- **Human checkpoints**: Three mandatory pause points — (1) search strategy approval before running searches, (2) title/abstract screening review, (3) full-text extraction + RoB review before pooling
- **Composes with Evidence Evaluator**: Use `SciSpark-ai/evidence_evaluator` for per-study RoB 2.0 assessment in Phase 2

## Tech Context

- All Phase 3 statistical computation is deterministic Python (scipy, statsmodels, numpy)
- Phase 1 (Identify) and Phase 2 (Appraise) are agent reasoning + API calls — no Python modules needed
- Phase 3 (Synthesize) invokes Python pipeline modules deterministically
- All Python commands must run from `skills/meta-analyst/` directory for imports to resolve
- Search databases: PubMed E-utilities, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov API v2
